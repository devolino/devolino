- 👋 Hi, I’m @devolino
- 👀 I’m interested in a music, lights, silly implementations of useful stuff, and languages (both computer and human).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Japanese, a little on accident. I'm trying to Get Good at Python for some stuff at work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: idk I'm sure I'll stumble across something that catches my attention?? I'm very new here, am I supposed to just
be like "hey this is cool can I add some stuff?" I don't know the etiquette. If you're reading this because I did something obnoxious, 
I am very sorry and please tell me so I know

I feel like hackerman every time I do the most minor thing that requires multiple windows of code and/or terminals open, 
and I think I'm just chasing that feeling forever.

I want to learn more signal processing. Partially for work, but also almost everything I'm interested in is like 
one step away from "I'd be better at this if I was better at signal processing"

I'm really good at making stuff work, and have a heavy technical background, but I still feel like a toddler when I'm 
around Real Programmers(tm) and really want to get over it.
